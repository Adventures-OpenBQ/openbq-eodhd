"""The SDK must honour OpenBB's configured HTTP settings.

Every other provider reaches the network through openbb_core's helpers, so a
proxy / CA bundle / client cert / timeout set under python_settings.http
applies to all of them. This extension uses the official EODHD SDK, which
builds its own bare requests.Session -- these tests pin the wiring that closes
that gap, and the SDK-internal attribute names it depends on.
