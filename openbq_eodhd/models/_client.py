"""Official EODHD SDK client helpers shared by all fetchers.

Every HTTP call in this extension goes through the official `eodhd` package
(`APIClient`) — https://github.com/EodHistoricalData/EODHD-APIs-Python-Financial-Library.
The dependency is pinned to a GitHub commit because the PyPI release (1.0.32)
predates the SDK's typed errors (it can sys.exit() on API errors), request
timeouts, and the fundamentals `filter` parameter.

    Every other provider in the Platform reaches the network through

    client certificate or a request timeout configured under
    ``python_settings.http`` applies to all of them. This extension calls the
    official EODHD SDK instead -- a deliberate Ep. 9 choice -- and the SDK
    builds its own bare ``requests.Session``, so without this those settings
    were silently ignored for ``provider="eodhd"`` alone.

    ``_session`` and ``_timeout`` are SDK internals. That is tolerable here in
    a way core internals are not: the SDK is pinned to an exact commit, so it
    cannot drift underneath us without someone editing the pin. ``tests/
    test_client.py`` asserts both attributes still exist, so moving the pin
    fails CI rather than quietly reverting to unconfigured HTTP.

    Best-effort at runtime: if anything here fails we keep the SDK's defaults
    rather than take the provider down over transport preferences.
