"""A static three-level index of EODHD's economic-calendar event names.

EODHD's /economic-events endpoint sends only a bare event name in its `type`
field (e.g. "Core PPI", "Philly Fed Prices Paid") -- it never says who
publishes the statistic or which release it belongs to. The OpenBB standard
model's EconomicCalendarData carries both: `source` (who publishes it, e.g.
"BLS", "Federal Reserve", "Treasury") and `category` (which release it comes
from, e.g. "Producer Prices", "Philly Fed", "TIC"). This module supplies the
missing two levels so the calendar fetcher can fill them in.

The three levels, concretely:

    Source (level 1)   -- the publishing body: "BLS", "Federal Reserve", ...
      Release (level 2) -- the named release or survey: "Producer Prices",
                            "Philly Fed", "FOMC", ...
        Statistic (level 3) -- EODHD's own event name, verbatim, the only
                                thing the API actually sends: "Core PPI",
                                "Philly Fed Prices Paid", ...

TAXONOMY holds that tree exactly as curated (source -> release -> [event
names]). Every event name appears exactly once across the whole tree, so a
name determines its (source, release) pair uniquely -- EVENT_INDEX inverts
the tree into that lookup, built once at import. classify() is the only
entry point callers need; unrecognized or missing names resolve to
(None, None) rather than raising, since EODHD adds event names over time and
a new one showing up should not break the fetcher.
